DO you ever feel like you are being watched? Like out there right now there are eyes on you; viewing your every movement and essence, every step and stumble? Do you ever get nervous around lakes, rivers, ponds, or other bodies of water? Do you fear those that are feathered? Well you my friend may be suffering from Anatidephobia: the fear that somewhere, somehow a duck is watching you. Make no mistake, you are not alone. Around the globe there are hundreds of thousands of people like you, suffering in silence. Well no longer. Here at Anatidaephobia.org we strive to help leviate the pain that you people are in.
