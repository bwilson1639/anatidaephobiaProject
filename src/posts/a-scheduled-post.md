Your yard is your oasis, especially when the warm weather rolls around. Relaxing with family, friends or enjoying some me-time is always a welcome activity, especially in the comfort of your own space. However, peaceful moments can be interrupted by ~~birds~~ vile creatures such as duck or geese infesting your yard. Although ducks and geese may be cute, they also be dangerous and also may leave you some unpleasant droppings. Ducks and geese are attracted to many things in your yard including but not limited to you, your family, your kids, your food, baseball, reality tv and especially if you have a pool or any other water. Keep ducks and geese out of your yard by following these tips:

**Your Pet can Be a Repellent**


Not only is your pet lovable, they may also be a key factor in keeping geese and ducks at bay from living in your yard. If ducks or geese notice a predator, in this case it may be your dog or cat, they will likely keep their distance. Even if your animal is not necessarily aggressive or even has a predatory side, the sight of your pet may be enough to keep ducks and geese at bay.

**Use a Decoy**

As mentioned, ducks and geese will likely stay away from your space if they believe there is a threat lurking on your property. If you don’t have pets to use as predators, keep animal decoys on your property. You can use decoys such as swan, fox or coyote decoys, which will keep these birds scared and off of your property. If you have a pool you can also keep inflated animals in your pool such as alligators, whales or dolphins. This will not only provide a threatening appearance to your yard, but it may also prevent these birds from landing and swimming in your pool. When using the decoy method, make sure that you adjust the animals periodically by moving them around your yard in order to make it more realistic.

**Keep Your Yard Clean**

Ducks and geese may be attracted to your yard due to potential waste that may be laying around. If these animals know that your yard has any waste or left-over food, they will likely be attracted to your home and return often for an easy meal. If you do not want to attract these birds to your yard, keep your yard clean so these birds do not have another reason to stick around.



**Automatic Sprinklers**

If you are having trouble keeping ducks and geese off of your property, you may want to invest in motion-activated sprinklers. These sprinklers will go off when they detect movement, keeping the birds away as this sudden spray of water will certainly startle them and can be unpleasant.

**Use an Ultrasonic Repellent**

If you are dealing with ducks and geese in your yard, a harmless method to get these birds to leave is by using an ultrasonic repellent. This machine works by emitting a high-frequency sound that humans can’t hear, but that is annoying to birds. Although this method is harmless, it is certainly annoying to animals and can prevent them from staying on your property. Keep in mind that if you have a pet at home, this method may also be annoying for them, so turning it off when your pet is in the yard is a good idea.

**Duck and Geese Repellent**

There are also options that include chemical repellent to keep these birds away from your yard. Duck repellent is a chemical spray that is applied to your lawn and surrounding area to keep birds away. When considering this method, keep in mind that chemical sprays may be harmful and toxic if you have pets or children at home. Additionally, it may also ruin your lawn. If you are considering using chemicals and toxins, it may be time to call the professionals in order to keep you, your family and your pets safe.
