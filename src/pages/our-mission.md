Here at Anatidaephobia our mission is to help people who suffer from Anatidaephobia by eradicating ducks off of the face of the planet. Through your charitable donations of $100 a week we are able to supply and support our elite teams of scientists, researchers and opratives around the globe to systematically find and eradicate all ducks. Your money goes towards researching green and renewable duck pesticide, funding hunter cells internationally, and supporting our Duck destroyer 9000, a cheap and safe way for our clients to keep the fowl menace at bay.

In 2019 it was estimaded that there 49.5 million ducks in North America alone. We find this number to be appalling. Imagine you had 99 million eyes potentially staring you down. This is the threat billions face alone, but with your support we can face together.
