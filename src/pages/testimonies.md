Don't hear from just us, here are some people who support our cause:

!["As the Dean of Augustana, I feel that it is important that people know the struggle that many people, myself included, go through. Thank you anatidaephobiaDotOrg for supporting people like me. Get rid of those ducks!"](/images/dean-demetres-tryphonopoulos-web.png "Demetres P. Tryphonopoulos")

!["The only brief reprieve I get is when I see the last duck go down south for the summer. Even then I still fear that some might have stayed behind. Thank you anatidaephobiaDotOrg for the work you do for people like me"](/images/james-kariuki-award-main.jpg "James Kariuki, Associate Dean, Teaching")

!["For those who have taken the Glen Bird Course, they should be well aware that there are over 45 waterfowl species in Alberta. That's 45 too many. Thank you anatidaephobiaDotOrg for doing nature a favour. I'm almost positive this will have no longlasting impacts on our wetlands at all"](/images/glen-killam-award-notice-main.jpg "Glen Hvenegaard, PhD")

!["As long as the beavers are fine I don't care what happens to the ducks. Thank you anatidaephobiaDotOrg"](/images/glynnishood.jpg "Glynnis Hood, PhD")

!["While climate change is probably the larger problem at hand, it is good to see people interested in interacting with our planet Earth. Ducks though are very clearly not of this world, and eradicating them could possibly decrease global emissions. Win win."](/images/9mugjjlf_400x400.png "Greg King, PhD")

!["Honestly this is a topic that more people should be discussing. I can't think when I think about how the ducks are watching me and they are thinking about how I'm thinking. I'd get rid of them myself but then how would I teach Philosophy. Thank you anatidaephobiaDotOrg for letting me get back to my studies, and maybe one day grading those papers."](/images/315ff44855809d54a726e8c586da6618910c4812e16ad3eacc2580fe3adba825.jpg "Janet Wesselius, PhD")

!["I don't feel safe letting my children be outside knowing that these birds could be watching them. Thank you anatidaephobia for making Alberta a safer place"](/images/melanie-methot.jpg "Mélanie Méthot, PhD")
