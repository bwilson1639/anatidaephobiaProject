"As the Dean for Augustana, I'm overjoyed to hear that more peopel are bringing light to this cause. Student's shouldn't have to fear that there is birds of ill intent that could be watching them. I can barely sleep knowing that they are out there. Thank you AnatidaephobiaDotOrg for supporting both myself, our faculty, and most importantly our students." -Demetres P. Tryphonopoulos, Dean of Augustana

"The only brief reprieve I get is when I see the last duck go down south for the summer. Even then I still fear that some might have stayed behind. Thank you anatidaephobiaDotOrg for the work you do for people like me" -James Kariuki, Associate Dean, Teaching 

!["For those who have taken the Glen Bird Course, they should be well aware that there are over 45 waterfowl species in Alberta. That's 45 too many. Thank you anatidaephobiaDotOrg for doing nature a favour. I'm almost positive this will have no longlasting impacts on our wetlands at all"](/images/glen-killam-award-notice-main.jpg "Glen Hvenegaard, PhD")

!["While climate change is probably the larger problem at hand, it is good to see people interested in interacting with our planet Earth. Ducks though are very clearly not of this world, and eradicating them could possibly decrease global emissions. Win win."](/images/9mugjjlf_400x400.png "Greg King, PhD")

!["Honestly this is a topic that more people should be discussing. I can't think when I think about how the ducks are watching me and they are thinking about how I'm thinking. I'd get rid of them myself but then how would I teach Philosophy. Thank you anatidaephobiaDotOrg for letting me get back to my studies, and maybe one day grading those papers."](/images/315ff44855809d54a726e8c586da6618910c4812e16ad3eacc2580fe3adba825.jpg "Janet Wesselius, PhD")
